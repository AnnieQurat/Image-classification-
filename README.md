## Short description

### What's the problem?

Use SkLearn to run exploratory analysis on a dataset to better understand it and its features. Process and prepare the data to apply the machine learning knowledge. This will include creating, analysing and generating predictions with classification models.

## Data Preparation and visualization

Data Set: 
The dataset provided contains pixel ifnormtion of many 28x28 grayscale images of clothing. THey are labelled as one of the 10 different pieces of clothing: class_labels = [T-shit/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankleboot]

a) Split data into dependent and independent variables, 
b) Visualize the data,
c) Class visualization,
d) Average visualization 

## Binary Classification

Logistic Regression to perform binary classification

e) If the item is piece of clothing (T-shit, pullover, shirt, trouser, dress, or coat), label it as 1, and rest as 0
f) Binary Classification Model 
g) Predict test data and report accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall and f1 score
h) Evluate model using ROC and precision-recall curve
i) Plot learning curve of logistic regression model

## Multiclass classification using Logistic Regression

j) Train and cross-validate logistic regression,
k) Test logistic regression,

## Multiclass Classification using SVR

l) Grid Search to find best model
m) Test the best model

## Multiclass Classification using Decision Trees

n) Grid Search to find best model
o) Test the best model
